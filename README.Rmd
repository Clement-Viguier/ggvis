## ggvis

```{r echo=F}
library(ggvis)
library(ggplot2)
```

This package is an extension of ggplot2 to enables faster design exploration for data visualisation.
 
For now it contains only the custom geom_dash that allows to plot dashes instead of points.
Those can be rotated (aes_angle in radiant) or widden (aes_width) to encode additional information in comparison of geom_points.

It also allows distribution visualisation like geom_rug.

```{r echo=T}
iris %>% ggplot(aes(Species , Petal.Length)) + geom_dash(width = 0.8)
```
